# num_methods

-- numMethods.py is a collection of my implementation of some basic numerical algorithms like fourth order Runge-Kutta method for differential equations

-- lorentz_oscillator.py solves the Lorentz oscillator set of three differential equations using the RK4 algorithm from numMethods.py. Using python's animator package I plot the result as an animation
